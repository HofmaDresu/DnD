# Selith
* Darkeyed woman of the 8th dahn
* Acts very submissive and afraid of lighteyes, because that's what she thinks they want and it helps keep her out of their plots
* Other darkeyes tend to follow her lead
* Advantage on survival and leadership roles


## Ideas
* Potentially an adversary to Kasmir somehow. Someone who knows clues to his past but doesn't want him to? Needs workshopping
