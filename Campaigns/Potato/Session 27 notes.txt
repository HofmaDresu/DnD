We're in the allyway, we head back through the marketplace. I keep the gold, it's 300g. There's a pst noise, balol and berrion step into the allie to investigate. There's a hooded figure, covered in darkness. Berrion summons shadow behind the figure and has him tap the figure on the shoulder. The figure talks to shadow, but no one hears what he said. He seems to be lifting his robe. Balol is walking backwards to see if anyone is following them. They're fairly certain no one's watching them. Shadow starts pantimiming laughter, then dissappears. The figure is just saying "drugs, drugs, drugs". He wants drugs. Balol lies that he has a powerful drug, it's just incense. The guy offers Tuna for drugs. He looks very feline. He's also wearing a cat-like mask. He offers elegant slippers for the drugs. They're little cats or mice look. Balol asks for information about the Fetcher. He says 'bad man'. Says 'stay away'. "You don't see fetcher, fetcher comes for you". Balol gives the incense for the slippers. The B's rejoin the rest of us. They tell us they sold drugs for shoes. 

We continue on to the tavern, bringing the kobolts. We enter the Crying Bell. It looks rustic and warm from the outside: sandstone bricks and hardwood pillars. Hard to see through the closed windows, but sounds like there's entertainment going on in there. RJ just gots distracted by a cat. The bartender is rushing back and forth serving drinks. Lots of wood on the interior. There are many portraits on the wall, one of which is the bartender. It's quite packed, lots of adventurers and travelors. There are long tables that are occupied by people sharing many drinks. There seems to be a drinking competiton. Some tables are pushing the edge of drunkenness. There are a couple unoccupied tables. The bar is quite popular. Thava gets food for the little kobolts. There are enough chairs in the corner for everyone. I sit as far from the kobolts as possible. Elle tries to get us lodging before we're all drunk. Balol wanders the tavern just listening to conversations. He hear's someone complaining about being pick-pocketed. There's a pause in the drinking game to let new people join. Berrion and Rash join the drinking games. They welcome us to the game. They're going to start Dwarven Roulette. Multiple mugs are filled with beer, one is filled with something else. Grab mugs until you get the bad one. I decide to join. Berrion also joins, so does Balol. I go first: I get number 4. I slam it, it's got a good flavor of honey and other goodness. NPC 1 gets beer. NPC 2 gets beer! Balol goes. Balol fakes disgust but got beer. Berrion goes: he gets the bad one! He tries to play it stoic, but can't help but look disgusted. I play a fun drinking trick, others start doing their own and the atmosphere gets awesome. Thava gets accosted by a drunk and has her kids rob him blind. Thava gets a ring for her dastardly deed. We overhear the other patrons talking about Tailorc Swift. I retire for the night. Berrion stays down in the tavern. He hears that a hag runs the orphanage, but someone else says that's bullshit. He also said there were witch hunters heading north. He tells us about these in the morning. We swap rumors in the morning. 

I have a wild maybe-dream. Write it down from Per's text later.

Galibar doesn't wake Elle for her shift. She goes looking for him, finds him in a deep meditation. It's around 4:15am. 

My alarm alers me to us being crimed by another kobolt. I wake the rest of the room and berrion gives chase. He sees 3 kobolts, they're scurrying out through a window to the roof. Balol tries to find his way to the roof. Our backpacks are still there, but my spellbook is gone. I hav galibar give me a ladder up. I start chasing after berrion. I yell to him "they have my book, stab them!". Elle transforms into a hawk. Balol sees the creatures climbing onto the roof. Thava checks on the little thieves from the morning, they're still sleeping. Balol paralizes one of them with hold person. I come up to the top floor and climb onto the roof. The other 2 went west and south. I tried to catch one with an illusion, but fail. Berrion catches the other one. We sync back up, i get my spellbook back. We get rope to tie them up. 

Some people woke from the commotion. We try to set up a trap for the fetcher's collector. Thava plays with precious to pass time. Time keeps passing, no one approaches. Random people walk by, but no-one takes note of me. We give up on this plan and decide to go to the orphanage. Thava feels something sharp on her neck and gets some threatening speach. She psionic mind's berrion: 'look behind me'. Berrion notice that the movement of the crowd seems coordinating. Thava tries the smack whatever's behind her with her tail. She connects, they shoot the crossbow. It hits, dealing 23 points of physical damage + 15 points of poison damange.

End Combat. The street starts filling up with civilians. Berrion casts 2nd level heal on me for 11 health

The main guy was wearing a mask like the face of a lion, but with larger teeth. We realize we lost the little kids. We loot the corpses, there's not much on them. No notes, no sending stones, nothing. There are no tatoos. Most are wearing masks, but no relation between them. They looked like random local joes. They don't appear to be ruffians or bandits. We head back to our rooms.
